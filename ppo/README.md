# PPO Bare-Metal Implementation
I follow the instruction by Eric, which tells us how to implement a PPO by ourselves. Check his github repo [here](https://github.com/ericyangyu/PPO-for-Beginners) and his [tutorials](https://medium.com/@eyyu) on his Medium page. I really found these pretty useful!!!
