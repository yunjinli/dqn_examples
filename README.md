# Bare metal implementation for some descent reinforcement learning algorithm
There are a lots of descent RL algorithms from [Stable Baseline](https://github.com/Stable-Baselines-Team/stable-baselines). I believe the best way of learning the magic behind those algorithms would be just getting our hands dirty and trying to implement them on our own.
